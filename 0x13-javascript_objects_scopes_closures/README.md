JavaScript - Objects, Scopes, and Closures
Summary
This JavaScript project involves the creation of classes and functions, exploring the concepts of objects, scopes, and closures. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

Function Prototypes
The project includes several JavaScript scripts with function prototypes, addressing various functionalities such as counting occurrences in a list, reversing a list, logging function arguments, and converting numbers between bases.

Tasks
Rectangle Classes (0-4):

Definition of a basic Rectangle class with the ability to initialize dimensions and print the rectangle.
Extension of the class to include methods for rotating and doubling the rectangle's size.
Square Classes (5-6):

Creation of a Square class inheriting from the Rectangle class.
Implementation of additional features such as character printing.
List Operations (7-10):

Functions for counting occurrences, reversing lists, logging arguments, and converting numbers between bases.
Array Manipulation (100-102):

Scripts for mapping array values based on their indices, sorting occurrences in a dictionary, and concatenating files.
The project demonstrates the application of fundamental JavaScript concepts, providing practical examples of class inheritance, function prototypes, and array manipulation.
