Object-relational mapping
The project delves into understanding object-relational mapping in Python, particularly focusing on MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy for database interactions. Various Python scripts are provided, each with specific tasks such as querying, creating, editing, and deleting tables within the MySQL database. These tasks range from retrieving all states, filtering states by specific criteria, handling user input for state filtering, preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities, to working with relational models and establishing relationships between tables. The scripts employ SQLAlchemy to interact with the database, perform CRUD operations, and manage relationships between tables effectively.
